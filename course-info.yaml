summary: "In our everyday life, we work with data, they are all in different formats.\
  \ One of the most known types of data is text. Sometimes we need to get some statistics\
  \ about the texts we read, or we generate some data in text format, and we want\
  \ it to be nicely formatted to be easy to read for others. In this project, we will\
  \ develop a useful tool that will analyze the text, generate statistics about it,\
  \ and format it if needed."
